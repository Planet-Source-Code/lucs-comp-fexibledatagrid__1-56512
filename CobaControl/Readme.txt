This OCX created based on flexibility of MS Access Database to lay out
grid with sub form. I dreamed that I have datagrid control with combo
bound to a database, check box, dt picker and text box that allow us
dirrectly change data on it.


Easy to use, very useful.. just set property. But it still has limitation:
only 3 datacombos, 3 CheckBoxs, 1 dtpicker and 1 Text box.


Of course this is not perfect control, still many bugs found but I think
it already could use as well.


But I'm on my way to accomplish it...


The big problem the control is vbdatasource type and I still cann't 
lay datagrid without lay another control (which not visible) on form 
which bound to this control only for trigger. If one of you can solve 
this, please..please let me know...


I also accept critics, suggestions, etc. And if you have a problem to 
use this control and setting its property please feel free to contact me.
